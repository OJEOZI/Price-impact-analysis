## PRICE IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Introduction
From November 1st 2023, Sweettooth and cornerstore did a price increase on most of its products. By the end of that month it was pertinent to carry out an analysis of the effects(if any) of this price increase. To achieve this, a comparative analysis was carried out between the previous month; october, where products was sold at the old price and november when the new prices was implemented. This inquiry intended to go beyond mere eyes observation to get detailed specific facts about the price increase and advise and make recommendations to relevant departments aimed at the organisation's progresss. 
### Basic goals of the project
* Observe if there exist any relationship between unit price of products and total sales revenue for a period of time.
* Observe the level of relationship (if any) between price of products and units of products customers tend to purchase.
* Understanding customers prefered methods of payment.
### Actionable results
* Noticed there was a significant increase in sales revenue despite units of products sold dipping. while the organisation hopes to sell more units, there however wasn't any significant impact on the total sales revenue.
* At sweettooth for example there was a slight decrease in units per purchase as a result of change in price. Recommendations of combo sales was made to this effect to unsure that customers atleast maintains the quantity of products they purchase before the price increase.
* While the majority of customers prefered making payments with their ATM cards, we found that more customers prefered to make transfer payments at the cafe/lounge than at the confectionary shop. Hence, recommendations was made to the accounting team and sales representatives to reserve a special account for transfer at the cafe/lounge in order to reduce the network issues that might be caused by traffic which is likely obtainable when used by the confectionary and the cafe same time.
### Data Collection and Data Cleaning
Sales data from the month of october and november was exported from the Point Of Sale(POS) software to a csv file. The cleaning process was done with excel; appropraitely attending to duplicates, missing values, unnecessary columns etc., checking validity of data and ensuring all columns had the right data type.
### Data Analysis and Vizualization
This project was analyzed using Excel and SQL. SQL queries was for example used to extract the percentage of products paid for by the various methods of payments. which revealed how customers preferwed to pay for that period of time. Excel pivot tables was also utilized for some insights. The WHERE clause in SQL and the LIKE operator alongside the wildcard character was also used for the analysis. Excel was used for this dashboard creation.
